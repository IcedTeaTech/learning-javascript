// 1. Assign your first name to a variable called firstName
let firstName = "Jesse";

// 2. Assign your last name to a variable called lastName
let lastName = "Kroon";

// 3. Print both variables to the console on two different lines
console.log(firstName);
console.log(lastName);

// BONUS: Try printing your full name to the console on one line (you can do this in two different ways)
console.log(firstName + ' ' + lastName);
